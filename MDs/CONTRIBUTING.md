# ðŸ”¥ Contributing to SYNTH

Thank you for choosing chaos over comfort.

This repository exists to **mutate audio** and produce
**living sound systems** that evolve through experimentation.

---

## âœ… Contribution Rules of Mutation
- Instability is expected â€” **break things**
- Document your chaos in **EXPERIMENT_LOG.md**
- Rules exist to be violated â€” as long as you explain **why**
- Push experiments through *feature branches*:
```
mutation/<idea-name>
```

---

## ðŸ§  What Makes a Good Mutation?
- Exploits artifacts (aliasing, bitâ€‘crush ghosts)
- Glitch engines that **selfâ€‘distort over time**
- Bass with **tectonic intent**
- Experiments inspired by biology, robotics, kinetic sculpture

---

## ðŸ“¡ Submitting PRs
Every PR must include:
- What rule or expectation was broken
- What mutated behavior emerged
- Why this belongs in the lab

PR template coming soon.
