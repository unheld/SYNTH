# 🧬 SYNTH — A Laboratory for Living Audio

SYNTH is an evolving audio engine dedicated to designing
**self‑mutating glitch organisms** and **generative bass futures**.

This is **not** a finished product.  
This is a **laboratory**.

---

## 🔥 What This Is
- Experimental sound design instrument / DSP engine
- A space where **errors are energy**
- Collaboration hub for unconventional prototypes

## 🧪 If You Are Here To Experiment
Start here:
- [MANIFESTO.md](./MANIFESTO.md)
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

---

## 🧭 Repo Structure (Proposed)
```
/Source        → core DSP code (actively mutating)
/Experiments   → unstable / abandoned prototypes
/Documents     → notes, schematics, research
```

---

## 🚀 How to Build
See: [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md)
